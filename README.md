# GESTURE_PHASE_MODEL
Machine Learning Project
Machine Learning Model designed to predict the state of a hand gesture and classify it into five given types of gestures. The model take sinput in form of various vecto values to identify the gesture and predicts the next gesture on basis of the trained data.
